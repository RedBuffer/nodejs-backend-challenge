# Red Buffer Backend Coding Challenge (Node.js)

## Get a leg up on the competition!

We are really excited to have you join us for this technical interview! During the session, you are going to meet one of our developers, and together you will work through some exercises that will allow you to show off your skills in both [architecture​](#architecture) and [​coding​](#coding).

For you to have a fun and smooth experience, here are some things you should know.

## Background

Throughout the session, we will be working on an imaginary product that we call a *"Risk Assessment Service​"*. Together with one of us. you will take the role of the technical co-founder of a startup.

Merchants want to allow their customers to purchase their products on credit. To make an accurate risk decision, we offer the merchant to integrate against our risk assessment service. When the customer clicks the buy button, the merchant sends a request to our risk assessment service with information about the customer and the purchase, and we respond with a decision.

It’s up to the risk assessment service to keep track of running debt per user and make an accurate decision based on the information it has.

## Architecture

In this first portion of the interview, we will ask you to create and iterate on a design for this system. As we introduce new requirements, the design will evolve. During the interview we will use [Sketchboard](​https://sketchboard.me/) to sketch the problem and solution. You will receive a unique link prior to or during the interview. In the meantime, please play around with sketchboard to get familiarized with its functionality and features.

*Tip: Keep it simple!*

## Coding

This repository includes the running project. You can find the description about setting up the project [here](Project.md). To save time, we ask that you please make sure you are able to run the project before the interview. If you have any issues, get back to the person that sent you the project, and we will help you out.

During the interview, we will work together to add some additional functionality to this project.

*Tip: The project may not be a real product, but we still want it to be production ready.*
